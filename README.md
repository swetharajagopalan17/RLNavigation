# RLNavigation
This repository contains the files and documentation required for developing environments to train robots for obstacle avoidance

The goal of our project was to develop environments with no obstacles, static, and dynamic obstacles, and compare the learning performance of the robot in the different environments. Our project utilizes the Gym-Gazebo repository, the turtlebot robot, and learning algorithms from the Keras-RL Library (particularly the algorithm used for training the Atari games).

So far, we have created these environments and tested them using the Gazebo simulator and are trying to run the trained models on a real robot.
